# Learning-Tensorflow
Learning Tensorflow from basics from the book: https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow
It covers tensorflow from very basics and assumes very little knowledge of ML.
It's a short book and quite hands-on, hence I am going over this book and replicating the code to learn tensorflow.
Putting all the notebooks here so that I can later refer.
